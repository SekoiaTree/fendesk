# Fendesk
A desktop version of [fend](https://printfn.github.io/fend/), built using [tauri](https://tauri.app).

### TODO
- [ ] Add extra commands like CTRL-D, CTRL-S (what should that do?)
- [ ] Add exchange rates
- [ ] Add options like config-defined functions
- [ ] Syntax highlighting; units should be a different color from text, math symbols too, etc.
- [ ] System tray

# Features
- Slight syntax highlighting!
- Shortcuts!
  - Ctrl-D quits the program (that's the only one for now)
- A nice UI! (mostly taken from the website)
